ðŸ“˜ Data Science Notes
ðŸ”¹ What is Data Science?

Data Science is a field that uses programming, statistics, and domain knowledge to extract insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines math, technology, and business to solve real-world problems using data.

ðŸ”¹ Stages of Data Science
Data Collection â€“ From databases, APIs, web scraping, IoT devices, and surveys.
Data Cleaning â€“ Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct errors.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Use stats and visuals (charts, trends, correlations).
Modeling â€“ Use ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, K-Means).
Evaluation â€“ Measure performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
Deployment â€“ Integrate model into apps, APIs, cloud systems.
ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies
Languages: Python, R, SQL
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Platforms: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Tableau
