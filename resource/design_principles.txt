                        Key Principles
                        
                            Contrast: Making elements stand out from each other.
                            Repetition: Reusing elements throughout the design for consistency.
                            Alignment: Arranging elements intentionally, not randomly.
                            Proximity: Grouping related items together.
                        
                        Color Theory
                        Understanding the color wheel, harmonies (complementary, analogous, triadic), and the psychological impact of colors.
                        Typography
                        Choosing appropriate fonts, font pairings, hierarchy, kerning, leading, and tracking.
                        Composition
                        Arranging elements within the design space using principles like balance, hierarchy, and the rule of thirds.
